temporary todos not yet in GitHub issues, which is the official place for this kind of thing

soon
----

* bugfix release bpython to use 0.0.32 and not higher
    * make a bugfix 0.0.* branch
* Update readme (still talks about terminal objects)
* release a new version of curtsies
  * do a bugfix release of bpython first
* more tests! Even ones that just cover surface area! Everything py2/3 different that's testable

eventually:
-----------

* real docs (not just a readme!) - after technical writing talk on Monday
  * docs should have colored strings somehow!
* consider adding more support for realtime uses
* fix escape sequence parsing / use a library so all kinds of escape sequences work in bpython
* consider adding basic window functionality etc.
