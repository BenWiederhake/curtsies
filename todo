temporary todos not yet in GitHub issues, which is the official place for this kind of thing

soon
----

* make api more beautiful!
* example using select
* release a new version
* bugfix release bpython to use 0.0.32 and not higher (figure out what 'curtsies>=0.0.32' means)
* split out tests into multiple files
* add a bpython-style cursor offset demo - some kind of REPL-y thing that preserves history the same way.
* add a realtime demo
* more tests! Even ones that just cover surface area! Everything py2/3 different that's testable

eventually:
-----------

* real docs (not just a readme!) 
* reconsider api for nonblocking version
* fix escape sequence parsing / use a library so all kinds of escape sequences work in bpython
* add more demos! (Sturm demos are awesome)
* investigate the global api, like https://github.com/darius/sturm/ (keep the objects behind the scenes)
