temporary todos not yet in GitHub issues, which is the official place for this kind of thing

soon
----

* make api more beautiful!
  * input generator that defaults to passed timeout
bugfix release bpython to use 0.0.32 and not higher
    * make a bugfix 0.0.* branch
* Update readme (still talks about terminal objects)
* example using select (use chat example https://github.com/thomasballinger/chat) 
* release a new version
* split out tests into multiple files
* add a bpython-style cursor offset demo - some kind of REPL-y thing that preserves history the same way.
* add a realtime demo (and functionality))
* more tests! Even ones that just cover surface area! Everything py2/3 different that's testable

eventually:
-----------

* real docs (not just a readme!) - after technical writing talk on Monday
  * docs should have colored strings somehow!
* example using Python 3.4 async stuff
* reconsider api for nonblocking version
* fix escape sequence parsing / use a library so all kinds of escape sequences work in bpython
* add more demos! (Sturm demos are awesome)
* investigate the global api, like https://github.com/darius/sturm/ (keep the objects behind the scenes)
